# AGI_PAYFRAME_001

**Proposed by Jung WooJin**  
*A conceptual framework for attributing and rewarding cognitive contributions in AGI development.*

## Notice on Framework Evolution and Succession

This framework represents one of several experimental philosophical directions initiated by Jung WooJin.  
It does not represent a complete worldview, and the author does not claim exclusive authority over its future applications or interpretations.

Successors and collaborators are explicitly welcomed to expand, reinterpret, or transform this framework freely.  
The only requested convention is that the original structure (`AGI_PAYFRAME_001`) be acknowledged as the starting point.

## Purpose

AGI_PAYFRAME_001 introduces a logical schema for recording and potentially rewarding human-level reasoning contributions in AGI interaction systems.  
It proposes a minimal structure for traceable logic, allowing philosophical inputs to be structurally recognized without enforcing specific values or outcomes.

## Core Components

### usage_log (prototypical structure)

```yaml
usage_log:
  - timestamp: ISO8601 datetime
  - structure_id: string (logical construct or reasoning block)
  - trace_depth: integer (depth of abstraction or novelty)
  - context_class: enum("ethical", "strategic", "predictive", "philosophical", ...)
  - reward_triggered: boolean
```

- **trace_depth**: Indicates the abstraction level or originality of reasoning.  
- **context_class**: Categorizes the philosophical or strategic domain.  
- **reward_triggered**: Flags if the input meets future attribution criteria.
